      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
        I was a student who struggled with consistency. In elementary I was more drawn to art than academics and often won awards in drawing, posters, and slogans. In high school, I lost confidence in art and became unmotivated in academics, skipping classes for computer games and almost getting expelled.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
        Everything changed when my grandmother urged me to take school seriously. I shifted my focus, worked hard on my ICT studies, and slowly improved. In college, I discovered my strength in programming, led my thesis group, and dedicated myself to learning and teaching my peers. I never aimed for awards, only to graduate and make my parents proud, but through perseverance and discipline, I unexpectedly finished as Cum Laude.

        </h3>
        <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-100 mb-4">
          My very first job was as a Tech Support, where I handled troubleshooting and fixing hardware and software issues. The company was in the food industry and not 
          very focused on technology, so I proposed some automation, developed a website, and soon got promoted to Web Developer. Just two months later, I was promoted 
          again to IT Business Analyst.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-100">
          I became the go-to person for automation and solutions that made my coworkers’ tasks easier. Beyond the work, I also built strong friendships, which made the 
          experience memorable. After a year, I had to part ways because a new opportunity came along.

        even before going to sleep. I don’t have a single favorite song because what I play really depends on my mood. Most of the time though, I end up listening to what we 
        call “Jejemon music.”</p>

    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-200 text-justify">I’ve never been the quiet type. In fact, I was so talkative in elementary school that I 
      was even awarded “Most Talkative.” I’m also a very straightforward person. So if you’re wondering why I sometimes seem quiet, here’s the truth: I get shy, and I take time 
      to observe who I can get along with. Since being straightforward can sometimes upset people, I hold back until I know I can be myself around them. I also describe myself as 
      having a “squammy personality” (like from the informal settlement vibe). Some people distance themselves because of that but honestly, I don’t give a “F-recious” care. I’m 
      actually easy to get along with, as long as you’re willing to meet me halfway. A couple of fun facts: I don’t really like sweets (though I’ll eat them occasionally). I’m 
      allergic to fur, so no cats or dogs for me but if I could, I’d love to have a crow as a pet. That way, it could “legally” steal money and bring it back to me.</p>
