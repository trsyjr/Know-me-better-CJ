        Who I am as a student.
      </h3>
      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
        I was a student who struggled with consistency. In elementary I was more drawn to art than academics and often won awards in drawing, posters, and slogans. In high school, I lost confidence in art and became unmotivated in academics, skipping classes for computer games and almost getting expelled.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
        Everything changed when my grandmother urged me to take school seriously. I shifted my focus, worked hard on my ICT studies, and slowly improved. In college, I discovered my strength in programming, led my thesis group, and dedicated myself to learning and teaching my peers. I never aimed for awards, only to graduate and make my parents proud, but through perseverance and discipline, I unexpectedly finished as Cum Laude.

          My first job shaped my growth.
        </h3>
        <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-100 mb-4">
          My very first job was as a Tech Support, where I handled troubleshooting and fixing hardware and software issues. The company was in the food industry and not very focused on technology, so I proposed some automation, developed a website, and soon got promoted to Web Developer. Just two months later, I was promoted again to IT Business Analyst.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-100">
          I became the go-to person for automation and solutions that made my coworkers’ tasks easier. Beyond the work, I also built strong friendships, which made the experience memorable. After a year, I had to part ways because a new opportunity came along.

      My favorite hobby on weekends is freelancing, where I do photo editing in Photoshop or video editing in Adobe Premiere. Sometimes I also take on small programming projects, which started as a hobby but occasionally earn me extra income.
